### PID controller overview ###





### the effect of the P, I, D component of the PID algorithm in their implementation.

Visual aids are encouraged, i.e. record of a small video of the car in the simulator and describe what each component is set to.

Please include in your writeup a description of the the effect of the P, I, D component of the PID algorithm in your implementation. Thanks!

Hint: Note that in general P cause the car to move toward the reference trajectory but will overshoot and cause oscillations, d helps to combat oscillations and i helps to combat bias. You could try various type of controllers (P. PD, and PID) to lay down the impact of each of the components.

### how to choose the final hyperparameters (P, I, D coefficients). 
This could be have been done through manual tuning, twiddle, SGD, or something else, or a combination!

Please include in the writeup a discussion of how you chose the final hyperparameters (P, I, D coefficients). Thank you!
